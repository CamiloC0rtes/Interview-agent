      "prompt": "Why do I keep getting verification codes when I log in?",
      "answer": "It sounds like you might be encountering issues with your Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) setup. If you're receiving verification codes every time you log in, it could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. **Device Not Remembered**: If you haven't selected the \"Remember this device\" option during your login, your device won't be recognized for future logins, prompting MFA each time.\n\n2. **Cookie Expiration**: If you did select \"Remember this device,\" keep in mind that this setting is valid for 30 days. After that period, you'll need to go through MFA again.\n\n3. **Location Change**: If you're logging in from a location that's more than 500 miles away from your last successful login, an 'Identity Alert' email is triggered, and you may be required to verify your identity again.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, please check your device settings or consider reaching out for further assistance once manual reviews resume on the next business day.
